Loading a shared C++ library from LuaJIT through FFI
====================================================

This repository contains the code for a tutorial on using LuaJIT's FFI to load
a shared library. The shared library here is written in C++, so we need to do
some tricks to get it working.

Building the examples
---------------------

Type `make`, optionally using `make -e` to use environment variables to
override `Makefile` variables.
